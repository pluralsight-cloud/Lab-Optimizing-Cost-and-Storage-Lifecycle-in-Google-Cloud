# GCP Cost Optimization Lab

This lab environment is **functionally correct but cost-inefficient**.

All workloads run successfully, but the architecture does not
account for:
- Data access patterns
- Compute utilization
- Non-production cost controls

Your goal is to **audit and improve the architecture** using
cloud architect judgment — not trial-and-error configuration.

Nothing here is broken from a functionality perspective.
It is broken from a **cost perspective**.
